## Estimation Guidelines

### Story Points Reference

| Points | Complexity | Effort | Risk |
|--------|-----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Very Simple | < 2 hours | None |
| 2 | Simple | 2-4 hours | Low |
| 3 | Medium | 1 day | Low |
| 5 | Complex | 2-3 days | Medium |
| 8 | Very Complex | 4-5 days | High |
| 13 | Epic | 1-2 weeks | High |

### Planning Poker Guidelines
- Use Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
- Stories > 13 should be broken down
- Estimate based on complexity, not time
- Re-estimate if scope changes significantly
